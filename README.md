# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Nicholas Ly**

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/principled-thundering-observation

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Although I didn't find the logic of this problem to be too difficult, I did find learning
brand new languages a bit tricky, especially three at once. For example, I would instinctly
leave lines without a semicolon because I've recently been doing classwork in Python, but
then I'd quickly realize that a semicolon should be present. I overcame this problem by
typing out as much code out myself, even though it may have been given. Doing this was my
attempt at breaking that instinctive muscle memory of other coding languages. Although optional,
I also wanted to do some of the other tasks, such as randomizing the pattern. As someone who is
new to JavaScript, I had no idea where to start. I am familar with the random functions in both
Python and C++, and they seemed relatively common enough for me to assume JavaScript had something
similar. I overcame this issue by double-checking with a quick internet search, in which I found
out I was correct.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

For the first time I have sat down and coded in any sort of web development language, I am really
excited to learn more. I am curious as to how three different langauges, although separate, are
actually able to recognize and interact with each other so intuitively. I also would like to know
the differences, or even "pros-and-cons", of using JavaScript over other web development coding
languages. I have heard of many, and now after trying these couple out, I am eager to learn more
about others.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would love to explore the different types of
buttons/menus that JavaScript has to offer. One thing specific I have in mind after reading this
question is the possibility of implementing a drop down menu of sorts, and selecting a difficulty
level from the exposed options. And instead of simply increasing the speed of the pattern (which
I have already implemented), I was thinking about increasing the grid of colored squares, and even
increasing the length of the pattern. Not only does it seem completely possible to do so, but it
really add a good challenge to what feels like a classic memorization game.
